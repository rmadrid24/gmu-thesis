We use the following workloads to train and test the RL agent:

Phase 1. We change the interactive traces to use a data access size of 50B, a read-to-write ratio of 80-20, and 200 concurrent client threads. We change the batch traces to use a data access size of 8k, read-to-write ratio of 50-50, and 200 concurrent client threads. 

Phase 2. We change the interactive traces to use a data access size of 50B, a read-to-write ratio of 80-20, and 150 concurrent client threads. We change the batch traces to use a data access size of 8k, read-to-write ratio of 50-50, and 320 concurrent client threads.  

Phase 3. We change the interactive traces to use a data access size of 50B, a read-to-write ratio of 80-20, and 400 concurrent client threads. We change the batch traces to use a data access size of 4k, pure read, and 200 concurrent client threads.  

Phase 4. We change the interactive traces to use a data access size of 500B, a read-to-write ratio of 10-90, and 200 concurrent client threads. We change the batch traces to use a data access size of 4k, pure read, and 200 concurrent client threads.
