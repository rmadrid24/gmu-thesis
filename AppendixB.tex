  % \caption[Evaluation of NVM Middleware: Benchmark A]{Evaluation of the NVM Middleware's concurrency control mechanism when co-running a batch workload and a interactive workload with Zipfian request distribution and even distribution of read and write requests. The interactive workload is generated by YCSB, and two runs are performed configuring YCSB with 64B and 128B data access sizes. Both applications utilize 100 client threads to send requests to the NVM Middleware. The throughput (yellow line) and 99th percentile latency (green box plot) of each application are observed and compared against a baseline with no concurrency control (blue line and box plot).}
  \caption[Evaluation of NVM Middleware: Benchmark A]{Evaluation of the NVM Middleware's concurrency control mechanism when co-running SVD I/O traces (batch) and a YCSB workload (interactive) configured with zipfian request distribution and an even distribution of read and write requests. Two runs are performed configuring YCSB with 64B and 128B data access sizes. Both applications utilize 100 client threads to send requests to the NVM Middleware. The illustration presents statistics on throughput (yellow line) and 99th percentile latency (green box plot) obtained under different configurations of the NVM Middleware, denoted as $I/B$ (Interactive threads/Batch threads). These statistics are compared against a baseline scenario with no concurrency control (blue line and blue box plot). The latencies observed by YCSB are depicted as a distribution, ranging from the minimum to the maximum observed, along with quartiles and median values.}
